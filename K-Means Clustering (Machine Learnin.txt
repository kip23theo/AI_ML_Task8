 K-Means Clustering (Machine Learning Project)

Objective:
Perform end-to-end K-Means clustering on a dataset to identify meaningful data groupings using Python and Scikit-learn.

🔹 Steps Performed

Loaded dataset (via URL or file upload)

Preprocessed and scaled numeric features

Applied PCA for 2D visualization

Used Elbow and Silhouette methods to find optimal K

Trained final KMeans model

Visualized clusters and centroids

Exported results as clustered_results.csv

🔹 Tools & Libraries

Python (Google Colab)

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA, StandardScaler)

🔹 Output

Cluster visualizations (PCA 2D plot)

Cluster summary and centroids

Saved CSV with cluster labels
